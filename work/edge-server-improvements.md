# Edge Server Improvements

## Current State
The edge server combines NATS server, automation engine, and device gateway in a single Go binary.

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Device Discovery
- [ ] mDNS/Bonjour for local network discovery
- [ ] SSDP for UPnP devices
- [ ] Bluetooth LE scanning
- [ ] USB device detection
- [ ] Integration with existing protocols:
  - Zigbee (via zigbee2mqtt)
  - Z-Wave (via zwave-js)
  - HomeKit
  - Google Home local API
  - Hue Bridge

### 2. Local Automation Engine
- [ ] Load automations from NATS KV at startup
- [ ] Cache automations locally for offline operation
- [ ] Execute automations without cloud dependency
- [ ] Local state management
- [ ] Fallback to cloud when available

### 3. Security Enhancements
- [ ] TLS for all communications
- [ ] Device authentication/pairing
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Access control lists
- [ ] Audit logging

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Message batching
- [ ] Compression for cloud sync
- [ ] Efficient state synchronization
- [ ] Resource usage monitoring

### 5. Reliability Features
- [ ] Automatic reconnection with backoff
- [ ] Message queuing during disconnection
- [ ] State reconciliation after reconnect
- [ ] Health checks and self-healing
- [ ] Graceful degradation

### 6. Management Features
- [ ] Local web UI for configuration
- [ ] Backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Update mechanism
- [ ] Diagnostic tools
- [ ] Log aggregation

### 7. Device Abstractions
```go
type Device interface {
    GetID() string
    GetType() string
    GetState() map[string]interface{}
    SetState(map[string]interface{}) error
    GetCapabilities() []string
    Subscribe(handler func(Event))
}
```

### 8. Plugin System
- [ ] Dynamic loading of device plugins
- [ ] Plugin API for third-party integrations
- [ ] Sandboxed execution
- [ ] Plugin marketplace

### 9. Metrics and Monitoring
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint
- [ ] OpenTelemetry support
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] Resource usage tracking
- [ ] Event statistics

### 10. Configuration Management
- [ ] YAML configuration file
- [ ] Environment variable overrides
- [ ] Runtime reconfiguration
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] Migration tools

## Implementation Priority
1. Device discovery (mDNS, SSDP)
2. Local automation execution
3. Security (TLS, authentication)
4. Reliability (reconnection, queuing)
5. Plugin system
6. Advanced features

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with mock devices
- Performance benchmarks
- Stress testing
- Real device testing
