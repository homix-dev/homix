## Key Changes

### Task Commands
All documentation now references Task commands instead of shell scripts:
- `./run-dev.sh` → `task dev`
- `./test-service.sh` → `task services:discovery:test-integration`
- `./setup-local-nats.sh` → `task setup-dev`

### Development Workflow
Emphasized the Task-based workflow:
```bash
task check-deps    # Check dependencies
task setup-dev     # Setup development environment
task dev           # Run in development mode
task test          # Run all tests
task clean-all     # Clean everything
```

### Installation
Added documentation for the new installation capabilities:
```bash
task install       # Install binaries to /usr/local/bin
task services:discovery:install-service     # Linux systemd
task services:discovery:install-service-macos  # macOS launchd
```

## Best Practices Documented

1. **Always use Task commands** for consistency across platforms
2. **Check dependencies first** with `task check-deps`
3. **Use development mode** (`task dev`) for local development
4. **Run tests** with `task test` before committing
5. **Clean artifacts** with `task clean-all` when needed

## Next Steps

1. Create CONTRIBUTING.md guide
2. Add API documentation for the discovery service
3. Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
4. Add performance tuning documentation
5. Create deployment guide for production environments
